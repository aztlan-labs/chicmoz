          countries other than your own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our servers are located in France. If you are accessing our Services
          from outside France, please be aware that your information may be
          transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by
          those third parties with whom we may share your personal information
          (see "WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?"
          above), in France, and other countries.

        <p>
          If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United
          Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, then these countries may not necessarily
          have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as
          those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to
          protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy
          notice and applicable law.
        </p>
        <h3>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

          In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil
          the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required
          by law. We will only keep your personal information for as long as it
          is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
          longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
          accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice
          will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 6
          months past the termination of the user's account. When we have no
          ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information,
          we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is
          not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
          stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
          information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion
          is possible.{" "}
        </p>
        <h3>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
        <p>
          In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system
          of organisational and technical security measures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information security is of utmost importance to us. We have
          implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational
          security measures designed to protect the security of any personal
          information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
          secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet
          or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure,
          so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or
          other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our
          security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
          information. Although we will do our absolute best to protect your
          personal information, transmission of personal information to and from
          our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services
          within a secure environment.

          under 18 years of age.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18
          years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at
          least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and
          consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn

          been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
          measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become
          aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18,

        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
          activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
          online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
          uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
          signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to
          DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
          communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
          online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
          inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
          notice.

          Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
          determine you are the same person about whom we have the information
          in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to
          provide information so that we can match it with information you have
          previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request
          you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we
          can match the information you provide with the information we already
          have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method
          (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may
          also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will only use personal information provided in your request to
          verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent
          possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for
          the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your
          identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request
          that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying
